homebrew-lammps
===============

A hombrew formula for lamps. Eventually, I hope to include this in
homebrew/science, but let's make sure it works first ...

```
# get this repo
brew tap scicalculator/lammps

# check out the available options
# Please test them for me and leave feedback!
brew info lammps

# install
brew install lammps ${opts}
```

Please help me make this work better by testing options and giving
feedback. Hopefully, when all is said and done, we can add this to the
[homebrew/science][hbsci] repository!
